INTRODUCTION

PNPDB is both a web (CGI) frontend and a CLI tool interface for a
network patch cable and ports/outlets database.

It contains some hardcoded stuff to work nicely in our local enironment
at the IFM department of Linköping University like ports/outlet naming
standards/normalization that some day should be generalized a bit.

Most of the IFM-specific stuff should be located in the file "ifm.c".
